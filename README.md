# Spotify Song Recommender with Cosine Similarity

## Description
This Python project implements a song recommendation system that analyzes my liked songs playlist and recommends similar songs (in terms of audio features) from a separate playlist. It utilizes cosine similarity, a machine learning technique for measuring similarity between data points, to identify songs with similar audio features.

## Features
* Analyzes user's liked songs playlist to capture audio feature trends using spotify song metrics (Valence, liveness, etc.).
* Recommends songs from a separate playlist based on cosine similarity.
* Utilizes Python libraries for data manipulation and machine learning.

# Libraries Used
* pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
* spotipy: Interaction with Spotify API
* scikit-learn: Cosine similarity calculations

# N:B
This is a basic implementation and can be extended to incorporate more features like genre analysis or collaborative filtering techniques.
